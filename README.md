# Spaceman
This is a single player game of Spaceman. The game is played by clicking the
"Generate Random Word" button which will store a random word unknown to the player. 
The player will be able to see how many letters the word consists of indicated by 
the number of blank spaces. The player will be able to select a letter from A through Z as buttons on the screen. 
For each correct guess of a letter the word contains, the blank space will be filled by that letter. Otherwise, if a 
guess is incorrect, attempts remaining starting from 10 will decrease
by 1. The player will continue to select letters until either the word is correctly guessed in which 
case the player wins, or the player has ran through their 10 attempts and loses. 
Good luck!

# Next Steps

- In the future, I would like to have parts of a stick figure appear so that it corresponds with the number of increasing 
    incorrect guesses.
- As well as, I would like to have different sounds play throughout the game. For example, sound playing at the loading screen
    prior to selecting the "Generate Random Word" button, sound effects when selecting the letter buttons, and sounds for
    either winning or losing the game.
